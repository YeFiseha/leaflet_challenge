# visualize earthquake data from United States Geological Survey (USGS)

United States Geological Survey, or USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualize their earthquake data. In this challenge, we have been tasked with developing a way to visualize USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.

# part 1: Create the Earthquake Visualization – i.e., visualize an earthquake dataset. 

# First, Get the dataset. 

The GeoJSON Summary Format (usgs.gov) page is used to choose a dataset to visualize.

# Second, Import and visualize the data.

Using Leaflet, a map is created plotting all the earthquakes from the dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

•	The data markers reflect the magnitude of the earthquake by size and the depth of the earthquake by color.

•	Earthquakes with higher magnitudes appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth appear darker in color.

•	Popups are included to provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

•	A legend is created to provide context for the map data.
